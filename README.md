## Getting Started - Development

The project directory uses `yarn` as a package manager. Run `yarn` to install add dependencies and `yarn start` to run the app in development mode.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [UI5 Webcomponents for React](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/?path=/story/1-welcome-getting-started--page) as primary component library.

You can send in your contributions to this by creating Issues or sending a [Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request). You can also share your points in the slack group.
