- **Help localize** : To make this tool really useful for general Indian audience, it's important to have translations to local languages. The current translations might not be optimum as they have been done using automated APIs. It would be great if you can help translate this app to your native language and share this tool in your community. 
  - To simplify the translation process, we make use of [INTEGRTR Translation Hub](https://translate.integrtr.com). You can request access to **MySwastha** project on it by dropping a message [here](https://twitter.com/nitish_mehta) or [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitishmehta08).

- **Help Offline** : Spread this with people , take adequate precautions and most importantly **practice social distancing**

- **Like to use it for your country** : Please go ahead & fork the repository to add your country specific information. If you would like to use the same domain , please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/nitish_mehta).

## Getting Started - Development

The project directory uses `yarn` as a package manager. Run `yarn` to install add dependencies and `yarn start` to run the app in development mode.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [UI5 Webcomponents for React](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/?path=/story/1-welcome-getting-started--page) as primary component library.

You can send in your contributions to this by creating Issues or sending a [Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request). You can also share your points in the slack group.
